* Write testcases!


* The documentation for the --seed argument says default is to use
  system time, but in reality, a fixed number is used. 


* Obfuscate strings, by using \x sequences. 


* Obfuscate attributes and methods. The fundamental problem is that
  when referencing attributes/methods (with obj.attr or obj.meth), we
  do not know the type of obj. The Bicycle Repair Man project has some
  type detection code, which might be useful. 


* Replace all "import foo" with "import foo as somethingobfuscated". 


* Do not put noop-lines before from __future__ imports. 


* Make noop-lines even more unreadable by introducing variables in the
  "if" expression, and possible let multiple adjacent noop-lines form
  a single if-statement.
